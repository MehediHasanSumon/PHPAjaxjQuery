# CRUD Project using PHP, JavaScript, and AJAX

This project demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using PHP, JavaScript, and AJAX. The application allows you to manage student records in a MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

1. XAMPP: Ensure that you have XAMPP installed on your machine. You can download it here.

2. Database Setup: After installing XAMPP, start the Apache and MySQL servers. Create a new database named `ajaxjqueryapi` in phpMyAdmin.

3. Table Creation: Run the following SQL query in phpMyAdmin to create the necessary `students` table:

```bash
CREATE TABLE `students` (
`id` int(11) NOT NULL,
`name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
`roll` int(11) NOT NULL,
`department` varchar(255) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin;
```

4. Web Server: Clone this repository into the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MehediHasanSumon/PHPAjaxjQuery.git
```

## Project Structure

- `asset/favicon.svg`: Project favicon for the website.
- `css/style.css`: The CSS file for styling the UI.
- `js/ajaxscript.js`: The JavaScript file for handling frontend logic.
- `js/jquery.min.js`: jQuery library for simplifying JavaScript code.
